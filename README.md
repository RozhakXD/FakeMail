## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while using the FakeMail program, there are a few things you can check. First, make sure the domain you input is in the correct format, such as `@gmail.com`. An incorrect format could cause the program to exit or display an error. If the program exits when entering a small number of emails, ensure you input at least 100 emails for the program to function properly.

When using the email checker, verify that the file name and path are correct and that the file exists in the specified directory. If the file provided for the email checker is empty, use a different file that contains valid email entries. If the email validation process fails or takes too long, check your internet connection and ensure the service is working correctly. You may also try validating with a different email provider if issues persist.

- **Email Quantity**: It's recommended to generate more than 100 emails for optimal results.

- **File Validity Check**: Make sure the file provided for the email checker contains a valid email list.
